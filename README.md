# guessing_game

by Dan Schwartz

It's a guessing game made with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. The game asks the user to enter his/her name, then asks questions about me, the author. It can recognize correct, incorrect, and incoherent responses and ask the user to try again, and reports their final score at the end. If the user has answered any questions incorrectly, the game reports the correct answers to those questions.
