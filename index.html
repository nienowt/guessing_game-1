  <h1>Welcome to the guessing game!</h1>

  <h2>How the game works</h2>

  <p>This is a wonderful little game that will ask you three questions about me. The game will prompt you to enter your name, then ask for yes/no answers to the three questions. After you answer the questions, the game will report how many questions you answered correctly and tell you the correct answer to any that you got wrong.

  <h3>Technical details</h3>

  <p>The script prompts the user to enter their name and stores the response as a variable. It displays a welcome message created by concatening the name variable to a standard welcome, then proceeds with the questions. When the user answers correctly, the script will increment the correctAnswers variable by 1. When the user answers incorrectly, the script pushes a correction message to the incorrectAnswers array. When the user has responded to all three questions, the script creates a clarification message using correct English grammar (based on the number of incorrect questions, as determined by checking the length of the incorrectAnswers array). It then displays the score (correctAnswers) and the clarifying message (clarification).</p>
